    <p class="fty">After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with Jive Records in 1997 at age fifteen. Her first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), are among the best-selling albums of all time and made Spears the best-selling teenage artist of all time. With first-week sales of over 1.3 million copies, Oops!... I Did It Again held the record for the fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States for fifteen years. Spears adopted a more mature and provocative style for her albums Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and starred in the 2002 film Crossroads. She was executive producer of her fifth studio album, Blackout (2007), often referred to as her best work.[2] Following a series of highly publicized personal problems, promotion for the album was limited, and Spears was involuntarily placed in a conservatorship.</p>

    <p class="frd">Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera met as cast members on the set of The All-New Mickey Mouse Club in the early '90s. Though they initially had a friendship, the singers were often pitted against each other as they became pop icons in the early 2000s, which led to a feud</p>

    <h3 class="xdc">2000</h3>
    <p class="njih">When Aguilera and Spears turned from pretty schoolgirls into real beauties, their explosive debut singles were released almost simultaneously. It was from this moment that the public and the press began to compare which of the blondes was more talented and sexier. However, the singers themselves tried not to pay attention to such things.</p>
   <h3 class="hjk">2003</h3>
    <p class="vbn">But everything changed in 2003, when Madonna, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera performed at the MTV VMA.

During the performance of the hit Like A Virgin, Madonna kissed Britney on the lips. The celebrity did the same with Kristina, but few people paid attention to it.

It was all the fault of the video editing, when the camera was suddenly pointed at Justin Timberlake, with whom Britney Spears recently ended a relationship. Everyone wanted to see the singer's reaction. But Aguilera, you can say, was left out.</p>

    <h3 class="asdfwe">2004</h3>
    <p class="xcvbn">Some time after her performance on MTV VMA, Christina Aguilera gave an interview where she spoke unflatteringly about her colleague Britney Spears.

"Every time I tried to start a conversation with her, she always looked kind of nervous. She seems to me like a lost little girl who desperately needs guidance," the singer said.Britney's reaction was not long in coming. As part of the same show, Spears pretended that she did not believe that Kristina could say such a thing about her. However, Aguilera still seemed a little strange to her.

"We met by chance at a club one day, where she tried to kiss me. I politely said that I was glad to see her, and she replied that I was talking to her insincerely. And then I thought: "Kristina, what do you even mean by sincerity? Approach girls and kiss them after not seeing them for two years?"", — shared the pop star.

And a little later, another scandalous phrase of Aguilera surfaced in the press.

"I know Britney. She's not trailer trash, but that's exactly how she behaves," she said.</p>

    <p class="iuy">After Britney Spears' devastating speech in court, where she told the bitter truth about her life under her father's care, Kristina expressed words of support to her colleague. However, the pop star did not appreciate her act of sympathy, as Aguilera preferred to write about it online rather than say it live when reporters asked the artist to comment on the situation.</p>

<p class="qaz">"Refusing to speak when you know the truth is tantamount to lying," the pop star wrote on Instagram.</p>

    <p class="uyt">In an interview, Kristina admitted that a heart—to-heart conversation with Britney is something she will be immensely happy about. But Aguilera would not like to discuss the history of abusive guardianship behind her back.</p>
    <p class="wasd">"I've always been open to this conversation with her. But this is a topic that I definitely want to be careful with, because I don't want to talk incorrectly about someone I respect and admire so much," the singer explained.</p>

    <p class="vcxz">On the eve of the release of Britney's memoirs, Kristina was asked how high the chances were that the pop star would mention her in the book.</p>

<p class="olm">"Look, I don't know, I really don't know. What do I hope for? Probably because she's fine," she replied.</p>
